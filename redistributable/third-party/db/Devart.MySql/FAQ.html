  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I installed dotConnect for MySQL trial, then I have bought and
      installed the purchased version, but something went wrong.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Make sure you have uninstalled the trial version correctly.
      There should be no old (trial) assemblies present in your system. Uninstall
      dotConnect for MySQL and check your Global Assembly Cache and local folders for
      Devart.* assemblies. Remove all Devart.* files and reinstall
      dotConnect for MySQL.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade to a newer version of dotConnect for MySQL?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Close all running IDEs and help collections, then run the installation package of the newer version. 
    You will be prompted to uninstall the previous version; agree and then proceed to installing the newer build.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">You say, there are sample projects, but I can't find any.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you installed dotConnect for MySQL not in its typical mode. Please select
    <b>typical</b> when installing the product. All samples are installed by default in the
    <i>\Program Files\dotConnect\MySQL\Samples</i> folder.</span>

      <ul>
        <li>deploy the Devart runtime assemblies used by your application;</li>
        <li>include the technical license resource;</li>
        <li>in case your application uses provider factories, you also need to expose dotConnect for MySQL to the system.</li>

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade my projects to dotConnect for MySQL 5.00?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>
    In the 5.00 release there were some important name changes in the product.
Particularly, assemblies, namespaces, invariant name, and some types
were changed as follows:<br>

<i>"CoreLab.Data"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data";</i><br>
<i>"CoreLab.MySql"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.MySql";</i><br>
<i>"MySqlDirectFactory"</i> became <i>"MySqlProviderFactory";</i><br>
<i>Invariant name</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.MySql";</i></p>

<p>Your projects must be updated to be compatible with dotConnect for MySQL 5.0. Here is the list of files you should update:<br>
<i>*.csproj, *.vbproj</i> - references to assemblies<br>
<i>*.cs, *.vb</i> - namespaces<br>
<i>*.licx</i> - namespaces and assembly names<br>
<i>Web.config</i> - assembly names and web provider types</p>
<p>
This is done automatically when you invoke the Upgrade wizard from the Visual Studio menu: <i>Tools | MySQL | Upgrade Wizard</i>.

  <li>
        <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have received a message that Devart.Data is incompatible...</span><br>
  <span class="A">
<p>Devart data providers use a common assembly (Devart.Data.dll), so it is necessary to install compatible providers versions. We release our ADO.NET data providers in a single pack, thus releases from the same date should be compatible. Also, Devart data providers should warn you before installation if an incompatible version of Devart.Data.dll was detected.</p>

<p>You should put the <i>Devart.Data</i>, <i>Devart.Data.MySql</i>, and <i>Devart.Data.MySql.Entity</i> 
assemblies in the Bin folder of your application (or place these assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache).

  <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have a registered version of dotConnect for MySQL. Will I need to pay to upgrade to future versions?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>Since dotConnect for MySQL 4.00, all upgrades to future versions are free to users with an active dotConnect for MySQL Subscription.</p>
  </span>
  </li>
  <li>
  <span id="Qx" class="Q">What are the benefits of the dotConnect for MySQL Subscription Program?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
  <p><a name="subscriptionprogram"></a>The <b>dotConnect for MySQL Subscription Program</b> is an annual maintenance and support service
          for dotConnect for MySQL users.</p>
  <p>Users with a valid dotConnect for MySQL Subscription get the following benefits:</p>
     <ul>

  </li>
  </ol>


<span id="Category">Technical Licensing</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What is the licensing you use?</span><br>
    <span class="A">dotConnect for MySQL uses .NET component licensing. To build an operational
      application, dotConnect for MySQL requires a valid license. If no license is available,
      dotConnect for MySQL does not work.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to embed the license into my application?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Usually you do not have to care about embedding the license in your application.
      When you install dotConnect for MySQL, the system is configured so that licensing is done
      transparently. The license is automatically added to the project when you place a MySqlConnection
      component onto a form.<br />
      In some cases, you have to manually add the license. It is necessary for console applications,
      class libraries, some ASP.NET applications and
      existing projects initially built with a dotConnect for MySQL version that did not use component
      licensing, that is, 3.20 and older. For instructions on how to add the license manually, refer to the
      <script>
      if (RunningInHost()) {
        document.write("<a href='Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");
      } else {
        document.write("<a href='http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/mysql/docs/?Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening the connection, I get an exception saying "License not found...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This generally indicates that license information cannot be found, or you try to
      apply it in some way that does not suit the kind of application. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <i>licenses.licx</i> file, required for dotConnect for MySQL to function properly, cannot be found.</li>
        <li>The <i>licenses.licx</i> file is not added as an embedded resource.</li>
        <li>The <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> file is not found in ASP.NET applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To fix the problem, determine the type of your application and read the corresponding section of the "Licensing" topic.</p>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening the connection, I get an exception saying "License not valid...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This means that license information is found but it is incorrect. It usually happens in the following cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The project was earlier compiled with an old or trial version of dotConnect for MySQL. </li>
        <li>The <i>licenses.config</i> file used by a class library does not refer to the launched executable.</li>
        <li>The <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> file belongs to other application or needs to be recompiled.</li>
        <li>Something is wrong with the operating system or installation of dotConnect for MySQL.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you encounter one of these problems, do the following (the numbers of actions correspond to the numbers of the problems in the above list):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delete all files from the bin and obj folders and rebuild the project.</li>

<span id="Category">Connection pooling</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I call MySqlConnection.Open(), then Close(). The physical connection is still
      visible by the server. Isn't it a bug?</span><br>
    <span class="A">No, it is not. This is the Connection Pooling feature. The actual connection is not closed in
      order to be used later by your application. This boosts performance greatly.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get the following exception: "Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed..."
      What to do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">The full text of the exception is "Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to
      obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in
      use and max pool size was reached." It clearly states that you have run out of connections available.
      To solve the problem, increase the <i>Max Pool Size</i> connection string parameter value. The default
      value is 100. Another way to get extra connections is to clear one or all of the pools. Or you can
      turn connection pooling off using the <i>Pooling</i> connection string parameter.</span>

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Method MySqlConnection.Open() succeeds, but MySqlCommand.Execute() leads to exception.

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to prevent possible pooling problems?</span><br>
    <span class="A">You can clear the pool explicitly. Generally, the pool is cleared automatically
      when connections are idle or closed by the server. To force the operation, call the ClearPool or
      ClearAllPools methods. Another solution is to disable the pool completely (set Pooling=false
      in the connection string). If this does not help, the problem is not caused by pooling.</span>

      This can happen when MySqlCommandBuilder generates a query without a primary key field.
      To avoid it, use a custom update command instead of the one generated by MySqlCommandBuilder.
      This problem should not occur if the primary key field participates in the SELECT statement.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">No components can be found in the toolbox.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This can happen if the installation encountered some problems. You can add the
      components to the toolbox manually. This procedure is described in the <i>Installation</i> article

<span id="Category">General issues related to MySQL server</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">It looks like MySQL server does not process BLOB fields that are bigger than some limit...</span><br>
    <span class="A">The amount of data that can be transferred in single query is determined by the server variable
      <i>max_allowed_packet</i>. By default, this value is approximately 1 MB, which means that you can
      download or upload a BLOB value with the size of 1MB maximum. To increase this limit, assign a greater
      value to the max_allowed_packet variable, for instance:<br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;[mysqld]<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;max_allowed_packet=8M</i><br>
      This fragment of the my.ini file sets the max_allowed_packet value to 8 megabytes.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get the "Net packets out of order" message. What is this?</span><br>
    <span class="A">This means that you try to use incompatible server and client versions, which
      can happen when you're not in the Direct mode (the <i>MySqlConnection.Direct</i> property is false).
      Check that the <i>libmysql.dll</i> library corresponds to your server.<br>
      Another reason why you can receive this message is having some general troubles with the
      network. Check network segments and configurations.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get the "Commands out of sync" message. What is this?</span><br>
    <span class="A">This message is displayed when you do not close MySqlDataReader and try to
      execute another query on the same connection. To avoid the problem, you can apply either
      of the following methods:
      <ul>
        <li>Close MySqlDataReader.
        <li>Close MySqlConnection.
        <li>Set the MySqlCommand.FetchAll property to true.
      </ul>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Cannot connect to server on <i>%host name%</i>...</span><br>
    <span class="A">This is actual for the mobile edition. Use the IP of the server instead of its DNS name. It
      is recommended to use the internal IP address. For information on how to address a target machine,
      consult your network administrator.</span>
  </li>
    <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I use transactions but nothing happens when I issue ROLLBACK. Why?</span><br>
    <span class="A">In MySQL not every storage engine supports transactions. Probably, you use one of them.
      To use transactions, switch to some other storage engine, for example, InnoDB.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to get a result set from a stored procedure?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      This can be done in two ways. First, you can set <i>MySqlCommand.CommandType</i> to <i>StoredProcedure</i>
      and <i>CommandText</i> to the name of the procedure. Second, you can set <i>MySqlCommand.CommandType</i> to
      <i>Text</i> and <i>CommandText</i> to the CALL statement, for example, "<i>CALL MyProc()</i>", where MyProc
      is the name of the procedure. After either setup, issue the <i>MySqlCommand.ExecuteReader()</i> method.<br>
      If you need to retrieve just a scalar value from a stored function, you can do it through the parameter with <i>Direction</i> set to
      <i>System.Data.ParameterDirection.ReturnValue</i>. For an example on how to do it, refer
      to the "Using Parameters" article in the dotConnect for MySQL documentation.</span>
  </li>
    <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What about performance?</span><br>
    <span class="A">We regularly carry out performance tests on different databases with miscellaneous environments.
      The tests show that dotConnect for MySQL is much better than ODBC, OLEDB, and Connector/Net. Besides that,
      dotConnect for MySQL has many more features than any data provider, including Connector/Net.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Non-latin characters in my data are not retrieved correctly.</span><br>
    <span class="A"> Use the UTF-8 encoding. To enable it, set the <i>Connection.Unicode</i> property
      to true or include <i>Unicode=true;</i> in the connection string. Keep in mind, however, that this
      affects performance. So it is better to synchronize the default client encoding and database objects
      encoding if possible.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to connect to a server behind a firewall if the port I require is blocked?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Use SSH tunnelling. It is described in the <i>Using Secure Connections</i> article of the
      dotConnect for MySQL documentation.</span>
  </li>
</ol>

<span id="Category">Embedded server</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to specify which libmysqld.dll my application should use?</span><br>
    <span class="A">The application searches for this library exactly like for any other library. This
      is described in the reference to the SDK LoadLibrary function. It may be a good idea to distribute libmysqld.dll
      in the same folder with your application exe file to be sure that the server will be loaded.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to provide start-up parameters for an Embedded server?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>This can be done in two ways: either by using the my.ini file or specifying data as
      parameters in the connection string. The following example demonstrates how to employ the connection
      string for this purpose:</p>
      <p><i>User Id=root; Server Parameters=\"--basedir=c:/servers/embedded/;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--datadir=c:/servers/embedded/data/;\"
      Embedded=True;</i></p>
      <p>For more information, refer to the "Using Embedded Server" article in the dotConnect for MySQL documentation.
        For additional information on what can be specified as a start-up parameter, refer to the MySQL Server documentation.</p>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What else do I need to get my Embedded server up and running (besides libmysqld.dll)?</span><br>
    <span class="A">It is recommended that you copy the "share" folder from the server installation to the directory
      where libmysqld.dll resides (<i>basedir</i> in the example above). Additionally, create a folder for data inside the
      same directory (<i>datadir</i> in the example above). You may want to reproduce the folder structure from your server
      installation.

  </li>
</ol>

<span id="Category">Secure connections</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What types of secure connections are supported?</span><br>
    <span class="A">dotConnect for MySQL supports SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
      and SSH (Secure SHell) connections. Detailed information on the subject can be
      found in the <i>Using Secure Connections</i> article of the dotConnect for MySQL documentation.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What encryption protocols are supported?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>You can use the following protocols in SSL connections:
      DES(40), DES(56), DES(168), AES(128), AES(256), RC4(40), RC4(128), RC2(40).
      In SSH connections, you can use DES(168), Blowfish, and AES(128)</p>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have set up an SSL connection but it does not work. Why?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably, your server does not have SSL support. Check this using the following SQL statement:<br>
      <i>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_openssl'</i><br>
      If the server returns NO, please visit <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/ssl-connections.html">MySQL site</a>

  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Can I use third-party modules that are not included in DotNetNuke by default?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      Third-party modules of DotNetNuke are not supported. You can find the
      list of supported modules in Readme.html for DotNetNuke Data Provider
      for MySQL.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have updated my DotNetNuke installation to the latest version. Will it work with MySQL?</span><br>
