Now Available: FlowForce Server Beta 1


FlowForce=C2=AE Server Beta 1 is an exciting new tool designed to =
provide
comprehensive management and control over data transformations performed
by dedicated high-speed servers, on virtual machines, or on dedicated
workstations, depending on the scope of your project. It is being

MapForce=C2=AE
2012 Enterprise Edition and MapForce 2012 Professional Edition.=20

FlowForce Server Beta 1 supports definition and execution of triggers to
start data transformation jobs defined in MapForce data mappings.
Triggers can be based on various criteria, and may include time
triggers, file triggers (start a job when a file is changed or added),
and remote triggers (poll for changes on a server to trigger a job).=20

watch for incoming files, perform data transformations, extract or
insert information in databases, process EDI files, recognize and react
to changes on remote HTTP servers, move or delete intermediate working
files, and much more. With its powerful set of scheduling features and
advanced data mapping functionality, FlowForce Server Beta 1 lets you
efficiently manage, control and automate today's complex
enterprise-level data integration tasks.

Mastering Keyword Analysis with the MissionKit


Anyone who manages paid keyword search campaigns knows it's hard work!
That's why we set out to discover if we could simplify the analysis and
reporting process using MissionKit=C2=AE tools. Like many keyword
advertisers, we were viewing statistics in Adwords, downloading CSV
files, then spending hours massaging and manipulating the data in
spreadsheets to identify and format the information we required.

We wanted more immediate and in-depth reporting of keyword performance
while retaining full control of the process and managing everything
internally. SQL queries of a database of keyword statistics offer a
powerful and flexible alternative.

This article
<http://blog.altova.com/2011/11/mastering-paid-keywords.html>  explains
how we designed a project that allows us to creatively query the numbers
to quickly aggregate results based on various criteria and easily
identify trends over time. The chart below illustrates these advantages
by collecting data for a single Altova product - SemanticWorks - from
multiple campaigns over six individual months.

Check out this article
<http://blog.altova.com/2011/11/mastering-paid-keywords.html>  to see
how the database design, data mapping, and reporting features of the
Altova MissionKit can be applied to create an architecture to
efficiently track paid keyword performance.

                <h2>
                    Now Available: FlowForce Server Beta 1</h2>
                <p>
                   FlowForce&reg; Server Beta 1 is an exciting new tool designed to provide comprehensive management and control over data transformations perfo
rmed by dedicated high-speed servers, on virtual machines, or on dedicated workstations, depending on the scope of your project. It is being offered as a public
 beta test to all licensed users of Altova MapForce&reg; 2012 Enterprise Edition and MapForce 2012 Professional Edition.
                </p>
                <p>FlowForce Server Beta 1 supports definition and execution of triggers to start data transformation jobs defined in MapForce data mappings. Tr
iggers can be based on various criteria, and may include time triggers, file triggers (start a job when a file is changed or added), and remote triggers (poll f
or changes on a server to trigger a job). </p>
                      <img src="http://www.altova.com/images/newsletter/FlowForceServer.png" alt="FlowForce Server" />

sert information in databases, process EDI files, recognize and react to changes on remote HTTP servers, move or delete intermediate working files, and much mor
e. With its powerful set of scheduling features and advanced data mapping functionality, FlowForce Server Beta 1 lets you efficiently manage, control and automa

                <h2>
                   Mastering Keyword Analysis with the MissionKit</h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone who manages paid keyword search campaigns knows it's hard work! That's why we set out to discover if we could simplify the analysis a
nd reporting process using MissionKit&reg; tools. Like many keyword advertisers, we were viewing statistics in Adwords, downloading CSV files, then spending hou
rs massaging and manipulating the data in spreadsheets to identify and format the information we required.</p>

<p>We wanted more immediate and in-depth reporting of keyword performance while retaining full control of the process and managing everything internally. SQL qu
eries of a database of keyword statistics offer a powerful and flexible alternative.</p>

             <p> This <a href="http://blog.altova.com/2011/11/mastering-paid-keywords.html">article</a> explains how we designed a project that allows us to cre
atively query the numbers to quickly aggregate results based on various criteria and easily identify trends over time. The chart below illustrates these advanta
ges by collecting data for a single Altova product - SemanticWorks - from multiple campaigns over six individual months.</p>

                <img src="http://www.altova.com/images/newsletter/MissionKitKeywordAnalysisReport.png" alt="MissionKit Keyword Analysis Report" />
<p>Check out this <a href="http://blog.altova.com/2011/11/mastering-paid-keywords.html">article</a> to see how the database design, data mapping, and reporting
features of the Altova MissionKit can be applied to create an architecture to efficiently track paid keyword performance.</p>
